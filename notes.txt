I struggled with creating the queries in the resolver using graphql/typeorm and then I ran out of time.
I'm happy to explain how I would have done this.

I also converted the data into a relational database, everything related to this can be found in the 'misc' folder.

Example SQL query that I would have liked to convert to suit API:

 Engages the highest number of residents (returns 3 events that has had the highest unqiue number of attendees overall):

    select p.name, count(distinct(pa.resident_user_id)) from programs p
    join program_attendee pa on p.id = pa.program_id
    group by p.name
    order by count(distinct(pa.resident_user_id)) desc
    limit 3

    "Mimosa Brunch Lunch"	        - 196
    "Mother's Day Brunch Buffet"	- 196
